Steps for releasing xamarin iOS app to HockeyApp

Here are the general steps for releasing a Xamarin iOS app to HockeyApp:

Create an account on HockeyApp: You can sign up for a free account on the HockeyApp website.

Create a new app on HockeyApp: Once you have an account, you can create a new app on the HockeyApp dashboard. You'll need to provide some basic information about your app, such as its name, bundle identifier, and platform.

Integrate the HockeyApp SDK into your Xamarin iOS app: You will need to integrate the HockeyApp SDK into your Xamarin iOS app. This can be done by installing the HockeySDK.Xamarin NuGet package and configuring it with your app's bundle identifier and app ID.

Build and archive your app: Build and archive your Xamarin iOS app using Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio. This will create a .ipa file, which can be used to distribute your app.

Upload the app to HockeyApp: In the HockeyApp dashboard, select the app you created earlier and navigate to the "Releases" tab. You can then upload the .ipa file you created in the previous step.

Invite beta testers: Once your app is uploaded, you can invite beta testers to test it. You can invite beta testers by email, or by generating a public link that you can share with anyone.

Monitor and gather feedback: Once your beta testers have your app installed, you can monitor their feedback and crashes from the HockeyApp dashboard.

Release to App Store: Once you've completed the testing and resolved any issues, you can release the app to the App Store.
